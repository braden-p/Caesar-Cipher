##### NOTE:
This program was completed as part of the course MITx 6.00.1x - Introduction
to Computer Science and Programming using Python. The general framework, and some
of the functions were provided materials. The majority of the implementation is
my own work.
The provided functions include:
- `loadwords()`
- `is_word()`

The remainder of the function names were provided with pseudocode descriptions,
but the implementations are my own.
